<h1>Beginner's Guide to Arch Linux and its Derivatives</h1>
<p>This is a guide for someone who has not used Arch Linux or Arch-based distros before and teaches the must-knows
    of Arch Linux and Arch-based distributions. Manjaro is a popular distro which is based on Arch.<br>

<h2>Pacman</h2>
<p>Pacman is the default command-line package manager for Arch and its derivatives.
    Here are some important Pacman commands (make sure you match lowercase and uppercase, and replace
    <var>package-name</var> with the actual name of the package!):
    <h3>Install a package or packages by name:</h3>
    "sudo" or superuser privileges are required to install, remove or upgrade packages.<br>
    <code>sudo pacman -S <var>package-name</var></code><br>
    After typing this, type in your password for the superuser privileges and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    You will be asked for a confirmation, so type "y" for yes and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to proceed.
    To cancel, type "n" for no and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    <h3>Remove a package or packages by name:</h3>
    <code>sudo pacman -Rs <var>package-name</var></code><br>
    Just like while installing, you will be asked for the password and confirmation.
    <h3>Searching for packages</h3>
    Searching is essential if you don't know the name of the package. Superuser privileges are
    not required, since you are not making any changes to your computer. This searches the name
    and description of the packages.<br>
    <code>pacman -Ss <var>search-query</var></code><br>
    The output of this command will be:<br>
    <code><var>repository-name/package-name package-version</var><br>
        Description of package.</code>
    <h3>Upgrading packages and system:</h3>
    The same command is enough to check for updates, download package updates, install package updates
    and upgrade the system:<br>
    <code>sudo pacman -Syu</code>
    <h2>Managing packages the graphical way</h2>
    <p>Ubuntu and Fedora have "rpm" or "deb" files to install packages. Arch, on the other hand, is
        a little different. Everything is in one of its repositories. If you don't find what you're looking
        for in the repositories, it should be in the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Arch User Repository.
        </a></p>
    <h3>Building packages from TAR Balls</h3>
    <p>You can also build packages by downloading a .tar file from the Internet, which usually ends with .tar.gz or
        .tar.zst. Download it from
        the website for the respective software. Once it is downloaded, extract
        the archive with your archive manager. In case you didn't know, these files are compressed archives like
        .zip files. Open the
        extracted folder. You will see a file called "PKGBUILD". If you don't, you probably downloaded the source
        code of the package instead, so make sure you downloaded an Arch Linux package. Now, right click in the
        empty part of the extracted folder in your file manager and click "Open in terminal".
        If you're using KDE's Dolphin file manager, click the menu button on the top-right corner of the window >
        Show Panels > Terminal (or just press <kbd>F4</kbd>).
        You can also do this with the <span class="inline-code">cd</span> command - type in the terminal:<br>
        <code>cd <var>/path/to/folder</var></code><br>
        Don't forget to replace it with the location of the folder, for example:<br>
        <code>cd /home/user/Downloads/package-folder</code><br>
        After entering the folder, type the command:<br>
        <code>makepkg -si</code><br>
        And your package will install.</p>
