<h1>Why you should consider Linux</h1>
<p>Linux is an operating system kernel (the kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating
    system with complete control over everything in the system. It is an integral part of any operating system.
    It is the "portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory"). It is
    one of the least used desktop operating systems right now.
    But if it's something to consider, why do people use it less? Why <em>should</em> you consider it? Find out
    here!</p>
<h2>1. Security</h3>
    <p>Linux is more immune to viruses mainly because it's not widely used.
        What that means is, viruses and hackers target Windows because it's used a lot more and there's
        more chance of the virus "hitting their target". But this doesn't mean Windows is insecure. Microsoft is doing
        their
        best to provide good security. Here's an analogy: You have to shoot one of two targets. One is a lot
        bigger and one is a lot smaller. Whichever you shoot, you get the same result. So, you would rather shoot
        the bigger target, because there's more chance of hitting it. That's what viruses and hackers would
        choose, too. Linux is a small target, while Windows is the bigger one.</p><img src="/images/gufw.png" alt="gufw"

    <h2>2. Performance</h3>
        <p>Linux works on almost <strong>anything!</strong> Linux is faster
            because it usually has a lot lesser/smaller background services than Windows. Background services are the
            programs that don't have any content that is supposed to be shown to you. Some of them are required for the
            system to work, but some are not.</p>

        <h2>3. Variety</h3>
            <p>Linux has a large variety of "distros", which are actually just operating systems with the Linux kernel.
                So, you can choose whichever distro you like.</p>

            <p>Linux also has a variety of Desktop Environments, which have different features and look-and-feels.</p>
            <p>There are more advantages, but the bigger ones are covered here. Now let's see why Linux isn't popular.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is Linux Used Lesser?</h2>
            <p>Linux is definitely something to consider, but it isn't popular. This is because it just hasn't gained
                momentum yet, and also because computers usually come pre-installed with Windows and people don't want
                to take the effort to switch over.</p>

            <h2>The only disadvantage (in my opinion)</h3>
                <p>The only problem about Linux (in my opinion!) is the <strong>compatibility.</strong> This means that
                    some Windows files won't work in Linux, and also that Linux doesn't have many applications.</p>
