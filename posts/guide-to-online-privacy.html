<h1>A Guide to Better Online Privacy</h1>
<p>Cookies and analytics are eveywhere on the web today. You're being spied on by companies like Google and Facebook.
    But with a few little steps, you can be more private wherever you go one the Internet.</p>

<h2>Why do you need to care?</h2>
<p>You're being followed around by trackers, and they're almost completely for advertising. And who clicks on ads?
    <strong>Lesser than 10% of all people who see them.</strong><br>
    Let's say you were searching for a new phone on a few sites which all use Google for their tracking. Then, in pretty
    much every page that uses Google Ads, you'll see only phone advertisements. That's how these cross-site tracking
    systems try to get you to click on ads. Google makes a lot of money out of these ads (lots of information about
    Google's advertising profits is available everywhere). Companies sell your data to
    advertisers, which no one really likes.</p>

<h2>1. Web browser</h2>
<img src="/images/browsers.png" alt="Web browsers">
<p>The simplest way to have better overall privacy is to make sure your browser is private.<br>
    Google Chrome is not a private browser (Google is the biggest tracking company on the Internet, so don't expect them
    to make Chrome private). Consider switching to a private web browser from this list (order from most private to
    least private):</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Brave Browser</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Vivaldi Browser</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Mozilla Firefox</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>Apple Safari</li>
</ul>

<h3>Which should you choose?</h3>
<p>If you want maximum privacy, try <a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brave</a>. The
    most important feature about Brave is
    that it has built-in ad and tracker blocking. Since it's based on <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromium</a>, it will look and feel like Chrome.
    It's also the fastest browser in this list!</p>

<p><a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vivaldi</a> is the most customisable option,
    and is almost as private as Brave, since it offers built-in tracker and ad blocking too. Vivaldi is also based on
    Chromium. The speed is around the same as Brave's speed as well. Vivaldi is
    the most feature-rich and customisable option in this list, but it does take a little bit longer to launch compared
    to the other browsers.</p>

<p>The oldest browser on the list is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a>. Out of all the browsers on the list, Firefox is the one with the best
    ecosystem. It supports all major operating systems on desktop and mobile, and has a great syncing feature which
    encrypts your passwords while syncing.With a Firefox account, you can do more than just syncing. You can use <a
        href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket</a>, Firefox Monitor which alerts
    you if your data appeared in a breach, and more coming soon. Firefox blocks lots of trackers by default too.</p>

<p>If you only use Apple products, you can stick with Safari. It's private and simple and has all the basic features
    anyone would need.</p>

<h3>Settings to change in any browser</h3>
<p>Look for a setting in your browser which says something like "help improve this browser" or "send usage data" and
    turn it off. It makes things just a bit more private although no one is making money with this data or selling it.
</p>

<h2>2. Search Engine</h2>
<p>For a bigger step towards online anonymity, switch from Google Search to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/about"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href="https://startpage.com/en/about-us.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startpage</a>. DuckDuckGo has great instant answers and Startpage gets
    its results from Google without tracking you. Both these search engines don't track your searches or location.
    DuckDuckGo has a "Bangs"
    feature, which lets you search lots of other websites through DuckDuckGo itself. For example, if you type "!gh
    duckduckgo", it'll take you to the GitHub search page and searches for "duckduckgo." Startpage also has a special
    feature called "Anonymous View", which opens the result within the Startpage site, which completely masks your
    identity.</p>

<h2>3. An Optional Browser Extension</h2>
<p>There are a few browser extensions that can improve your privacy. If you're using Firefox, you can install <a
        href="https://https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">uBlock Origin</a> which is an ad and tracker blocker. Since Brave and Vivaldi already
    have good built-in blocking capabilities, you don't need it (but you could install it on Vivaldi if you want to,
    since Vivaldi doesn't block as many trackers as Brave)</p>
